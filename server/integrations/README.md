# Integration Handlers

This folder contains webhook handlers for different delivery platforms:

- `ifood-integration.ts` - iFood webhook handler
- `ubereats-integration.ts` - UberEats webhook handler
- `quero-integration.ts` - Quero Delivery webhook handler

Each handler processes incoming webhooks and creates orders in the Wilson Pizzaria system.

Status: ✅ Ready for webhook processing
Next: Need routes + storage integration in AUTONOMOUS MODE
